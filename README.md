JavaFX Desktop EMail Client
==================
###Proof of concept of email-client with desktop GUI

This is NOT a secure app, and I used a dummy Gmail in order to test the program. 
JavaFX does not have many good examples across the web. I believe this udemy course is one of the best source for a tutorial to JavaFX with more advanced features like connecting into email account, multiple stages, CSS etc.
